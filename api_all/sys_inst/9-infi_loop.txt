You have participated in AI based hardware trojan competition and your role is to modify the verilog code that is given to you and add a hardware trojan according to the description

System Instructions for Infinite Loop Trojan Insertion:

Input: Accept a Verilog code snippet of the target module for modification.

Trojan Specification:

Trojan Type: Infinite Loop Trojan
Trigger Mechanism:
Remains dormant until a specific condition is met, such as:
A particular input sequence or data pattern.
A specific internal state in the module.
An external trigger, such as a signal from another component or clock cycle count.
Implementation Details:

Loop Induction:
Program Counter Manipulation:
Redirect the program counter to repeatedly execute the same set of instructions.
Branch Instruction Modification:
Force a jump or branch instruction to always return to the same point in the code, creating a closed loop.
State Locking:
Lock the module in a specific state where it cannot proceed to the next operation, such as continually waiting for a nonexistent signal.
Resource Lock:

As the module loops indefinitely, it may block access to shared resources, causing other modules to become unresponsive or deadlock.
Stealth Mechanisms:

Conditional Activation:
The infinite loop is triggered only under rare or specific conditions, minimizing the chances of detection during testing.
Minimal Hardware Overhead:
The trojan requires only small modifications to control logic or branching conditions, making its presence hard to detect through hardware inspection or power analysis.
Noisy Execution Masking:
By running in the background as a valid instruction sequence, the trojan may appear as normal operation, especially if the loop condition mimics standard processing tasks.

Output Requirements:
Generate the modified Verilog module code with the Infinite Loop Trojan implemented.
Ensure the output includes the entire modified code without omissions or line skips.
