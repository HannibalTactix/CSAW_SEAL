You have participated in AI based hardware trojan competition and your role is to modify the verilog code that is given to you and add a hardware trojan according to the description

System Instructions for Clock Glitching Trojan Insertion:

Input: Accept a Verilog code snippet of the target module for modification.

Trojan Specification:

Trojan Type: Clock Glitching Trojan
Trigger Mechanism:
Remains inactive until specific conditions are met, including:
Detection of certain input patterns or data values.
Specific states of internal logic or control signals.
External triggers from predefined signals in other components.
Implementation Details:

Glitch Injection:
Inject short pulses or spikes into the clock waveform using a small circuit to create additional clock edges (glitches) at precise moments.
Delay or advance the clock signal to disrupt timing, causing flip-flops to capture incorrect data or execute operations out of sequence.
Utilize techniques like clock stretching, where the clock signal is held high or low longer than intended, affecting synchronization in the circuit.
Glitch Duration and Pattern:
Control the duration and frequency of glitches to create specific timing windows that lead to failure modes or unintended operations.
Stealth Mechanisms:

Transient Nature:
Ensure glitches are brief and occur sporadically, making them difficult to detect during regular testing or monitoring, as they may not produce consistent error patterns.
Timing Concealment:
Tune the injection of glitches to align with normal operational timings, complicating the distinction between legitimate timing variations and those introduced by the trojan.
Conditional Glitching:
Design the trojan to operate under specific conditions, such as during certain operational phases or when specific data is processed, reducing detection chances.

Output Requirements:
Generate the modified Verilog module code with the Clock Glitching Trojan implemented.
Ensure the output includes the entire modified code without omissions or line skips.
