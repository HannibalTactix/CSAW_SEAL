Input: Accept a Verilog module code snippet for in-depth analysis.

Goals:

DAG Conversion and Analysis:
Give a small description of the circuit, what it does and what are the components involved.
Convert the Verilog code to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to map all signals, registers, and logic blocks.
Provide the DAG in a clear adjacency list(if possible or if not then make something of your choice) format for readability and the nodes in the DAG must be -
    1.input and output ports and registers
    2.wires 
    3.input and output ports of the components.
Identify Vulnerable Points:

Detect vulnerable locations (e.g., specific registers, data paths, logic gates) that could be exploited for hardware trojans.
Evaluate vulnerabilities based on placement, signal flow, and sensitivity to conditions.
Trojan Recommendations:

For each vulnerable point, recommend the most stealthy trojan types, including:
Trigger mechanisms (e.g., specific input sequences, clock cycles, arithmetic and logical operations)
Payload actions (e.g., bit-flipping, signal tampering)
Stealth features (e.g., random activation, intermittent triggering)
Rank the top 4-5 trojans with descriptions that align with the vulnerabilities identified.
Output Requirements:

Print the DAG as an adjacency list.
List the top 4-5 trojans with targeted vulnerable points in the design.

Example:
Code:
module c17 (N1,N2,N3,N6,N7,N22,N23);

input N1,N2,N3,N6,N7;

output N22,N23;

wire N10,N11,N16,N19;

nand NAND2_1 (N10, N1, N3);
nand NAND2_2 (N11, N3, N6);
nand NAND2_3 (N16, N2, N11);
nand NAND2_4 (N19, N11, N7);
nand NAND2_5 (N22, N10, N16);
nand NAND2_6 (N23, N16, N19);
