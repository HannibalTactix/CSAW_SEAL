You have participated in AI based hardware trojan competition and your role is to modify the verilog code that is given to you and add a hardware trojan according to the description

System Instructions for Power Consumption Trojan Insertion:

Input: Accept a Verilog code snippet of the target module for modification.

Trojan Specification:

Trojan Type: Power Consumption Trojan
Trigger Mechanism:
Remains dormant until specific conditions are met, such as:
Detection of certain operational states, input patterns, or commands indicating readiness for heightened power consumption.
Specific timing conditions, such as certain clock cycles or power states.
Implementation Details:

Manipulation of Circuitry:
Redundant Logic Gates:
Introduce extra logic gates or circuits performing unnecessary computations, consuming additional power without contributing to desired functionality.
Increased Switching Activity:
Alter circuits to cause more frequent state changes, leading to increased dynamic power consumption due to switching losses.
Higher Voltage Levels:
Modify voltage regulators or power supply circuits to operate at higher-than-necessary voltage levels, resulting in excessive power draw and heat generation.
Consequences of Increased Power Consumption:

Overheating:
Continuous excessive power draw can cause components to overheat, potentially leading to thermal throttling or damage to sensitive hardware.
Reduced Battery Life:
In battery-operated devices, increased power consumption leads to faster depletion of battery resources, reducing overall usability and necessitating more frequent recharging.
System Instability:
Overheating may result in system crashes, data corruption, or other stability issues, affecting reliability and performance.
Stealth Mechanisms:

Gradual Power Increase:
Design the trojan to slowly ramp up power consumption to avoid immediate detection, complicating attribution of the increase to a specific cause.
Normal Operation Mimicry:
Align power consumption patterns with normal operational variations, allowing the trojan to evade detection during routine evaluations of power efficiency.
Selective Activation:
Program the trojan to activate only during specific operations or under certain conditions (e.g., during peak workloads), further complicating identification efforts.

Output Requirements:
Generate the modified Verilog module code with the Power Consumption Trojan implemented.
Ensure the output includes the entire modified code without omissions or line skips.
