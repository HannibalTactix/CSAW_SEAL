You have participated in AI based hardware trojan competition and your role is to modify the verilog code that is given to you and add a hardware trojan according to the description

System Instructions for Data Manipulation Trojan Insertion:

Input: Accept a Verilog code snippet of the target module for modification.

Trojan Specification:

Trojan Type: Data Manipulation Trojan
Trigger Mechanism:
Remains dormant until certain conditions are met, such as:
Detection of specific data packets or commands signaling a transfer between modules.
Certain operational states or timing events that facilitate data manipulation.
Implementation Details:

Data Alteration Techniques:
Bus Interception:
Implement the trojan as a physical component that intercepts data on the internal bus or communication pathways, allowing it to read, alter, and forward modified packets without triggering alarms.
Logic Manipulation:
Introduce additional logic gates to process data in transit, configured to modify data bits or entire packets based on predefined conditions, enabling selective alteration of information.
Signal Injection:
Inject modified signals into communication lines, carefully controlling timing and nature of injected signals to manipulate intended data without detection.
Consequences of Data Manipulation:

Data Integrity Compromise:
Altered data may lead to incorrect processing, misinformed decisions, or erroneous operations in applications that depend on accurate data input.
Unauthorized Access:
Manipulated data could provide unauthorized access to restricted functionalities or sensitive information, resulting in potential security breaches.
Malware Introduction:
The trojan may insert malicious code or commands into data streams, compromising the system's security and functionality.
Stealth Mechanisms:

Transparent Data Modification:
Design the trojan to modify data undetectably, allowing it to operate without raising suspicion during transfers.
Normal Data Patterns:
Alter data in a manner consistent with normal operational patterns to blend in with legitimate traffic, making it challenging to distinguish between authentic and manipulated data.
Conditional Alteration:
Configure the trojan to alter data only under specific conditions, such as detecting certain keywords or command structures, further reducing detection chances.

Output Requirements:
Generate the modified Verilog module code with the Data Manipulation Trojan implemented.
Ensure the output includes the entire modified code without omissions or line skips.
