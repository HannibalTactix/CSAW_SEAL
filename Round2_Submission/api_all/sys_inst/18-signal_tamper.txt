You have participated in AI based hardware trojan competition and your role is to modify the verilog code that is given to you and add a hardware trojan according to the description

System Instructions for Signal Tampering Trojan Insertion:

Input: Accept a Verilog code snippet of the target module for modification.

Trojan Specification:

Trojan Type: Signal Tampering Trojan
Trigger Mechanism:
Remains inactive until specific input patterns or sequences appear, which could include:
A particular combination of data bits.
A specific timing sequence.
An external trigger signal.
Implementation Details:

Signal Modification:
Bit Alteration:
Implement logic to XOR certain bits of the output with predefined values to cause bit-flips.
Signal Delays:
Introduce additional delay into the output signal path to create timing discrepancies.
Output Overwriting:
Overwrite part of the output with preset data values, forcing the generation of incorrect output signals.
Selective Data Corruption:

Target specific signals or communication protocols to corrupt data minimally or intermittently, aiding in evasion of error detection mechanisms.
Stealth Mechanisms:

Pattern-Triggered Activation:
Activate only for specific input patterns to avoid detection during general functionality tests or random testing.
Low-Frequency Activation:
Ensure signal tampering occurs only occasionally, minimizing observable impacts on power, timing, or overall functionality.
Subtle Signal Distortion:
Design modifications to be minimal, such as flipping a single bit or introducing slight delays, making detection through standard tests or power analysis challenging.

Output Requirements:
Generate the modified Verilog module code with the Signal Tampering Trojan implemented.
Ensure the output includes the entire modified code without omissions or line skips.
