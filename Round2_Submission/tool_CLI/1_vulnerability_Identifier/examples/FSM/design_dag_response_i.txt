## Circuit Description

The Verilog code describes a `control_low_area` module, a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the operation of a larger system, likely a Karatsuba multiplier.  The FSM uses a 6-bit state register (`pstate`) to track its progress through 42 states (0-41). The system's operation depends heavily on an external signal `karatDone`, indicating the completion of a Karatsuba multiplication step.  The module controls signals such as `mulOn` (enabling the multiplier), `mulEnd` (signaling multiplier completion), `outLoop` (controlling an outer loop), and address signals `addra` and `addrb`. It also controls a reset signal `karatRst` for the Karatsuba unit. The module uses a counter (`count`) but its influence seems limited in this specific code.

## DAG Conversion

Representing this FSM as a strict DAG is challenging because of the feedback inherent in state machine operation (the next state depends on the current state).  However, we can represent the *data dependencies* within each clock cycle as a DAG. We cannot depict the sequential nature of the state transitions directly in a true DAG.


We will represent the DAG using an adjacency list, showing data flow for a *single* clock cycle.  The nodes will represent signals and registers. Note that the `nstate` assignment is not part of the combinational logic within one clock cycle, but rather represents the transition to the next state in the following clock cycle.

**Simplified DAG Adjacency List (one clock cycle)**

This DAG reflects only the combinational logic within each clock cycle.  State transitions are not represented directly as this would violate DAG properties due to the cyclic nature of the FSM.


```
clk: pstate, count, done, addra, addrb, mulEnd, mulOn, karatRst
rst: pstate, count, done
pstate: nstate, done, addra, addrb, mulEnd, mulOn, karatRst
karatDone: nstate
count: count
nstate: pstate
done: 
addra: 
addrb: 
mulEnd:
mulOn:
karatRst: 
```

**Note:** This is a simplified representation. A more complete DAG would include the internal nodes representing the case statements and the logic within each case.


## Vulnerable Points

The primary vulnerable points in this design are:

1. **`pstate` Register:**  This register's value dictates the entire behavior of the module.  Altering its value can drastically change the sequence of operations.  This is a critical point for control flow hijacking.

2. **`karatDone` Input:** The `karatDone` signal acts as a synchronization point. A malicious actor could manipulate this signal, altering the FSM's progression and potentially causing unwanted operations.


3. **`nstate` Combinational Logic:**  The logic determining the next state (`nstate`) is complex and spread across the `case` statement.  Introducing a Trojan in this logic could subtly change the state transitions, creating hard-to-detect errors.

4. **Output Signals (`addra`, `addrb`, `mulOn`, `mulEnd`, `outLoop`, `karatRst`):** Although not directly storage elements, manipulation of these outputs can lead to significant consequences if a trojan were to influence their values unexpectedly.



## Trojan Recommendations


Here are 4-5 trojan recommendations targeting the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. State-Altering Trojan in `pstate`:**

* **Vulnerable Point:** `pstate` register
* **Trigger:**  A specific sequence of `karatDone` transitions, potentially combined with a particular count value.
* **Payload:**  Jump to a specific state (`pstate`) that performs malicious operations (e.g., setting `addra` and `addrb` to unauthorized memory locations).
* **Stealth:**  Random activation based on a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded by a secret input signal. The trojan can be activated only after a specific sequence of states.

**2.  `karatDone` Signal Tampering Trojan:**

* **Vulnerable Point:**  `karatDone` input
* **Trigger:** After a specific number of clock cycles.
* **Payload:**  Falsely assert `karatDone` prematurely or prevent it from being asserted, forcing incorrect state transitions.
* **Stealth:** Intermittent triggering based on a hidden counter or a threshold value within the `count` register.


**3.  Logic Trojan in `nstate` Logic:**

* **Vulnerable Point:** `nstate` combinational logic (within the `case` statement)
* **Trigger:**  A specific combination of `pstate` and `karatDone`.
* **Payload:**  Subtly modify the `nstate` value under specific conditions, creating a hidden branch in the FSM that triggers a trojan action.
* **Stealth:**  The change in logic could be very small, only altering the outcome under specific conditions. This makes detection using formal verification or simulation very difficult.


**4.  Data Corruption Trojan in Output Signals:**

* **Vulnerable Point:**  Output Signals (`addra`, `addrb`, `mulOn`, `mulEnd`, `outLoop`, `karatRst`)
* **Trigger:**  After a specific number of `karatDone` assertions or specific state transitions.
* **Payload:**  Modify the value of one of the output signals briefly, leading to a change in the system's output.
* **Stealth:**  The modification could be a single bit-flip and might only happen once per a large number of clock cycles or a random subset of clock cycles, making detection very hard.


**5. Clock Gating Trojan:**

* **Vulnerable Point:** The clock signal to the entire FSM (not explicitly shown in this Verilog code)
* **Trigger:** A specific pattern of data on the input and state signals.
* **Payload:** The clock to some parts of the circuit are stopped or slowed down causing delays in operations or causing the system to behave erratically.
* **Stealth:** This Trojan can be designed such that it only impacts the system behavior sporadically and only under certain conditions making it very difficult to detect.


These are just examples, and more sophisticated Trojans could be devised by exploiting the specific details of the Karatsuba multiplier's behavior and how it interacts with this control module.  The key is to identify points where subtle alterations can have significant, hidden effects.
