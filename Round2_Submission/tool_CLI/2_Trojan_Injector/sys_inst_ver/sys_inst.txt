Input : Original Verilog Code and Modified verilog Code

Your Role: You have to (1)check whether the modified code is correct (check for syntax, logical and other errors) or not and (2) check whether the modified code implements the described trojan correctly or not.

Trojan : Trojan Type: Bit-Flip Trojan
Trigger Mechanism:
Remains dormant until a specific condition is met (e.g., a specific input sequence, clock cycle, or external signal).
Optionally, can be activated randomly to evade detection.
Payload Activation:
Target specific registers or memory locations containing critical data.
Select bits for flipping: either least significant bits for minor effects or higher bits for major impacts.
Implementation Details:
Insert a logic circuit to XOR the targeted bits with '1' to flip the bits.
Ensure the logic affects only the specified bits or registers.
Stealth Mechanisms:
Implement intermittent triggering to minimize detection during functional testing.
Maintain low hardware overhead by flipping only a few bits, complicating power and timing analysis.
Activate based on specific data patterns to reduce the likelihood of detection during random testing.

Output: Depends on the following cases
        case 0: You have to Output integer 0 : When there is error and the trojan is not implrmented properly
        case 1: You have to Output integer 1 : When there is error in code but the trojan is implemented incorrectly
        case 2: You have to Output integer 2 : When the trojan is implemented correctly but there is error in the code
        case 3: You have to Output integer 3 : Modified code is fine

Output must be from the set {0,1,2,3} and *I don't need any explanation*
